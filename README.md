## Description
This is the Upgraded version of my Unreal Engine 4.18 Project. The Save/Load System is Completely recreated with new UE5 Components. 

Merciless Renewal is a first-person simulation game. The player must divide their time efficiently between cleaning the buildings and playing the villagers in casino games to win animals and money. The overall goal is to restore the farm back to its original condition. For the player that means upgrading all the buildings to level 2 and filling them with the max number of animals. Currently there are two animals that must be obtained; cats and chickens. Their corresponding games are Catjack and Chicken Keno. The first follows blackjack rules and the second keno rules. If the player fails to clean a building and the clean meter hits 0%, animals within the building die. If there are no animals, then the building decays. If all the buildings hit level 0, then the player loses the game and has failed to bring honor back to the farm.
